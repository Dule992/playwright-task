# Playwright-TypeScript-task

This README overviews the Playwright-based testing setup for AutomationExercise.com with TypeScript. You can expand on it depending on your specific needs or any additional tools you are using (e.g., reporting tools, test runners).

This project uses Playwright with TypeScript to perform automated end-to-end tests on the AutomationExercise.com website. 

AutomationExercise.com is an online store offering various products, and the purpose of these tests is to ensure the site's core functionality works as expected across different browsers.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=16.x) installed on your machine.
- npm or yarn for managing dependencies.

### Configuration
The Playwright configuration is set up to run tests on Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit. The configuration can be found in the playwright.config.ts file, and the tests are written in TypeScript for better code quality, type safety, and maintainability.
